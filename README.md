# CSIRT Tooling: Best Practices in Developing, Maintaining and Distributing Open Source Tools

The role of a CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) is key in information society and especially to improve cyber security in their constituencies and beyond. To achieve this, CSIRTs often have significant operational constraints such as limited budgets (in many settings, CSIRTs are considered cost centers), a bound number of resources or/and overloaded staff members
. Tooling, such as software or tools used in day-to-day activities in Digital Forensic, Incident Response and Threat Intelligence, offers CSIRTs to operate more efficiently the processing of
 constant flow of information and act in a timely manner (such as notifying victims, reporting, information sharing at European or International level or investigating technical evidences).
In the document, a set of best practices is described to help CSIRTs to develop, maintain and distribute existing or new Open Source tools.
